# Javascript Game
This is a rework of a javascript implementation of a simple ascii art RPG game using classes and variables with names that make sense. 

This game is used to facilitate an after-school computer club for high school students (ages 15 to 18). 

Many, many, many thanks go to Daniel and Ethen who beautifully rewrote the entire thing while muttering and complaining about doing their homework in Python. 
I would also be remiss not to thank previous generations of students who contributed their beautiful light and humor to this project. 

May the code flow.
